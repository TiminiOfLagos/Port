  about: `I'm a versatile professional with a strong academic background and three years of hands-on 
          experience managing businesses in the hospitality industry. Holding a Bachelor's degree in 
          Microbiology with second-class upper honors, I transitioned into product management, 
          serving as the Product Manager at Esusu Africa, a fintech company digitizing thrift savings. 
          Concurrently, I manage products at Friendnpal Healthcare, a pioneering AI mental health
           company. Notable achievements include leading a successful team of 5 in an hackathon in the web3 domain, 
           showcasing collaborative and strategic prowess. My journey reflects a commitment to growth
           and innovation, with a passion for leading transformative initiatives in the dynamic tech 
           sector. Looking forward, I aim to deepen my expertise and be a catalyst for positive change 
           in product management, contributing to industry redefinition and impactful advancements.`,
